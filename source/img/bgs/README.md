# The Backgrounds-Folder

Put your background-images (JPG, PNG, SVG) you're referencing in your SCSS-files in here.  

The JPG and PNG files will be processed by the imagemin-task and then copied to `build` or `dist`.

All SVG-files will be processed with the svgmin-task and put into the `tmp/svgmin/bgs` folder.  
Afterwards the svgcss-task uses these icons to produce SCSS-files (all icons are included as data-URIs in the form of SASS-placeholders), which will be put into `tmp/svg-bg-extends` folder.
